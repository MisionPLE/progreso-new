## Building
To generate all of the translations requires
the [loca](https://github.com/MisionPLE/loca) program.

Right now, the build process only works on Linux or MacOS:
    make

will generate html files for all the translations currently supported
(at the time of writing, english, spanish and portuguese).  To add more languages,
look at the [loca](https://github.com/MisionPLE/loca) documentation.
