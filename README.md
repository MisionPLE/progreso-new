## Viewing
Look for the [releases](https://github.com/MisionPLE/progreso-new/releases) to find ready-to-view zip files

## Building
To generate all of the translations requires
the [loca](https://github.com/MisionPLE/loca) program.

Right now, the build process only works on Linux or MacOS:
    
    make

will generate html files for all the translations currently supported
(at the time of writing, english, spanish and portuguese).  To add more languages,
look at the [loca](https://github.com/MisionPLE/loca) documentation.
